# Synthetic Data is Sufficient for Zero-Shot Visual Generalization from Offline Data

Welcome to the code repository for our ICLR 2025 submission, **"Synthetic Data is Sufficient for Zero-Shot Visual Generalization from Offline Data"**.

## Overview
This repository contains the necessary code to reproduce the experiments described in our paper. We utilize several submodules for different components of the project:

- **V-D4RL experiments**: Run using the `v-d4rl` submodule. Detailed instructions are available in the [original v-d4rl repository](https://github.com/conglu1997/v-d4rl).
- **Procgen experiments**: Run using the `gen_dgrl` submodule. Instructions can be found in the original code base.
- **Diffusion model sample generation**: Run using the `SynthER` submodule.

## Hyperparameters
All hyperparameters used in our experiments are available in the **Supplementary Material**.

## Dataset Adaptations
Some modifications are required to adapt the dataset for your specific use case, such as adjusting the input and output data sizes.

## Full Implementation Details
We are currently finalizing the complete implementation details and will provide them soon.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions. We appreciate your interest in our work and look forward to collaborating with the community!
